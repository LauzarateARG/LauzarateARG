### About Me
I am passionate about programming and being in constant search of new technologies.<br/>
My interest in programming started during my high school studies when I started to see different programming languages, 
But due to the pandemic just this year I decided to study javascript and focus on the development of web pages.<br/> 
Here I found a new world to explore and many colleagues to work with, this was what motivated me to fully introduce myself with these new technologies
